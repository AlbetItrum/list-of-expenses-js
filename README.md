# List of Expenses
About

In a nutshell: a private budgeting tool that can be self-hosted.
This project is an attempt to understand and control my own spending better without giving my banking/financial info to a 3rd party. The app is meant to be used with 1 login, and you can host easily your own instance.

Core technology stack (MERN):
1. mongodb
2. Express
3. JavaScript
4. nodeJS

Peculiarities:
All data is stored in the database - Mongodb, 
There is form validation both on the server side and on the client side
